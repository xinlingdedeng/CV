***\*Deep Heterogeneous Network for Temporal Set Prediction\**** 

The purpose of this project is to forecasting the elements in the subsequent set according to historical sequence of sets, namely temporal sets prediction.

***\*General Steps\****

Solve the difficulty of set representation, dynamic temporal dependence of historical sets and fusion of multi-level user preference.

Propose a novel Deep Heterogeneous Network for Temporal Sets Prediction (DHNTSP).

Design a set representation method based on Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) embedding, which is used to model the multiple relationships among sets, items, users and categories, and matrix factorization is used to vectorize the nodes of HIN. Then, an attention based recurrent module is designed to learn the temporal dependence of the historical sets. Last, a fusion module is designed to combine sequential-level and individual-level of user preference to further improve the performance.

Exceed the classical method in each evaluation.

 

***\*KDD Cup 2020 Challenges for Modern E-Commerce Platform: Debiasing\**** ***\*(\*******\*TOP 2%\*******\*)\****

This project focuses on the fairness of exposure, i.e., how to recommend items that are rarely exposed in the past, to combat the Matthew effect frequently encountered in a recommender system.

***\*General Steps\****

Analyze the correction for selection bias is to solve the selection bias and prevalence bias.

Use a two-tier model structure, one for recall and one for sorting. The first layer uses the ItemCF method. The second layer uses the XGBoost model.

Improved model：In the recall stage, an Item2Item graph is constructed, which has only commodity nodes and two kinds of edges, namely click-co-occurrence edge and multi-modal vector edge. Then, the multi-hop relationship between commodities was obtained through random walk. In the ranking of user preferences, the scoring weight of low popularity items is increased to further suppress high popularity items.

Enhance the effect of the model：select LightGBM and add commodity popularity weighted loss in the loss function to eliminate the popularity bias.

 

***\*2020 Language and Intelligence Challenge (TOP 7%)\****

The purpose of this project is to extract all SPO triples {S, P, O} that satisfy schema constraints in a given text sentence according to a predefined set of schema.

***\*Task Difficulties\****

Overlapping relationships: The same subject and object have different relationships; 

Complex relationship: the same subject and relationship correspond to multiple objects.

***\*General Steps\****

Use SPO extraction (DGCNN model. Recognition of subject, object and general relations) + slot filling (Bert-BiLSTM-CRF model for sequence labeling of complex relations).
